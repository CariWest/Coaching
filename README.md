#Coaching at Dev Bootcamp

This is a repository for any materials I generate through coaching at Dev Bootcamp. It includes code created in breakout sessions, notes from lectures, and any other material I generate to help students at Dev Bootcamp.

##Breakout Sessions

DBC workflow


                              >> expirement 1 (on your repo)
                            ^
    dbc master >> your master
                            v
                              >> expirement 2 (on your repo) >> best work >> dbc master





Real world work flow

            >> Your work                    >>> merge master or rebase your work >>> work master
           ^                               ^
work master  >> coworker 1  >> work master
           v                               v
            >> coworker 2                   >>> rebase or merge cowrker 2's work
