#Coaching at Dev Bootcamp

This is a repository for any materials I generate sometimes when I write I have to go to the bathroom so I stop through coaching at Dev Bootcamp. It includes code created in breakout sessions, notes from lectures, and any other material I generate to help students at Dev Bootcamp.

##Breakout Sessions
  * [Recursive Binary Search](https://github.com/CariWest/Coaching/blob/master/recursive_binary_search.rb)
  * [MVC Todo](https://github.com/CariWest///Coaching/blob/master/todo)
  * [Using an Arguments Hash](https://github.com/CariWest/Coaching/blob/master/123/examples/initialize_with_args.rb)
