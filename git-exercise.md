## Welcome to Git

  5. Push up changes
  6. Merge changes into YOUR repo
  7. Make a pull request to MY repo

## Can it be Easier?

Yes. With Caution. This workflow requires working off of master. While this seems like NBD, it might become a big deal in certain cases. For example, you might make a bunch of terrible changes which introduce bugs, but you haven't commited regularly. Also, you wouldn't be able to track two (or three or seventeen) different versions of your solution — which can be a super cool way to learn & improve as a programmer.

  1. Fork this Repo
  2. Clone YOUR repo to your computer
  3. Work on Master
  4. Push up changes to YOUR repo
  5. Make a pull request to MY repo

OR you could choose a workflow which never forks to your own GitHub account. This is a common practice at jobs, but it tends to be bad for DBC — you'll want a record of all your work on your own repo!

  1. Clone MY repo
